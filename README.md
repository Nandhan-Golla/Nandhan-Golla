### 🧠 About Me

I'm **Nandhan Golla**, a creator, coder, and architect of intelligence.  
Also known as **The AI Necromancer** — I *revive data*, *raise models*, and *reimagine the future* through the lens of machine intelligence.

I currently work at the intersection of cutting-edge AI, robotics, and quantum systems as part of the  
🎓 [**Centre of Excellence in AI & Robotics (AIR), VIT-AP**](https://air.vitap.ac.in/members/nandhan.html)

Driven by first-principles thinking and long-term vision, I believe AI isn’t just technology — it’s destiny.  
My goal? To engineer intelligent systems that reshape civilization.

### 🔮 Featured Work: Quantum GAN

**A quantum-enhanced generative adversarial network**  
Merging the uncertain probabilities of quantum computing with adversarial learning to explore the next evolution of intelligence.

> *“What if GANs could tap into quantum weirdness? Now they can.”*

### 🧭 Looking Forward

I aspire to build intelligent systems that don’t just respond — they **reason**.  
That don't just imitate — they **innovate**.

If you're building something *bold*, *intelligent*, or *impossible* — let's talk.  
Because the future won't wait, and neither will I.
