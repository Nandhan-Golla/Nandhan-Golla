### 🧙‍♂️ Who I Am

I'm **Nandhan Golla**, also known as **The AI Necromancer** —  
a creator who doesn't just code algorithms, but **summons** intelligence from raw, chaotic data.

Currently building my journey at the [**Centre of Excellence in AI & Robotics (AIR), VIT-AP**](https://air.vitap.ac.in/members/nandhan.html),  
I’m pushing toward a future where machines *don’t just compute — they understand.*

> I’m not here to follow the roadmap.  
> I’m here to redraw the map.

### 🚀 What Drives Me

I believe the future belongs to those who combine **logic with imagination** —  
those who are unafraid to question limits and build what doesn't exist yet.

- 🧠 Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- ⚛️ Quantum AI Systems
- 🤖 Reinforcement Learning for Autonomy
- 🧬 Generative & Cognitive Architectures
- 🌌 Machines That Think Beyond Narrow Scope

### 🧪 Featured Summoning: Quantum GAN

A hybrid model combining **Quantum Computing** with **Generative Adversarial Networks**  
— merging quantum superposition with generative intelligence.

> *Turning probabilities into creativity. Building GANs that think like qubits.*

### 🧭 My Vision

Imagine a world where intelligence isn't limited by silicon,  
but expanded by quantum logic, autonomous reasoning, and evolving cognition.

That’s the world I’m building toward.
